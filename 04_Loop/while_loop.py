#WHILE LOOP
#While loop have no limitations we need to break it with help of conditions.
#i.e. "i<10" is condition to break while loop after reached 9.
# i=1
# while i<10:
#     i+=1
#     if i==7:
#         break
#     print(i)

#While Else
#We can use else to continue loop after condition meets.
i=1
while i<6:
    print(i)
    i+=1
else:
    print("i is no longer less than 6")
