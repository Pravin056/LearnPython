10.Python Program to Print all Prime Numbers in an Interval.

Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers.
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

Examples:
    6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
    37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
